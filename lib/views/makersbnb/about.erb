<h1>About us</h1>

MakersBnB was born on Monday when four unwitting developers were forced together to embark on a exciting journey. <br>
We have since grown to 4 hosts who have welcomed more than 3 guest arrivals in the local area. <br>
Every day users discover new bugs on the site but MakersBnB offers one-of-a-kind stays at questionable properties. <br>
